## Plex plug-in that plays live streams using acestream engine ##

### Introduction ###
A [Plex Media Servers](https://www.plex.tv/downloads) plug-in that scrapes acestream links from the web and populate a list understandable by plex.

### Supported websites: ###

* AceListing
* Free Live Football Streaming
* LiveTV.sx
* Platin Sport
* Reddit - LiveTvLinks
* acestreamsearch.com

### Requirements ###
In order to stream content you need acestream engine running on the same computer or on the same network, I personally start the engine with options "--log-stdout --client-console"

You also need to change the settings in order to make this plugin aware of the acestream engine.
